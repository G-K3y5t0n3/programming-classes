Team Activity: Falling Object Calculator
Last Updated: 10/07/24
Author: Michael Jacob (MJ) Quizon

For this team activity, you will work together to implement a fairly complicated Physics formula.

Where:
m = mass (in kg)
g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2 on Earth, 24 m/s^2 on Jupiter)
t = time (in seconds)
c = 1/2 p A C
p = density of fluid (1.3 kg/m^3 for air, 1000 kg/m^3 for water)
A = cross sectional area of projectile (in square meters)
C = drag constant (0.5 for sphere, 1.1 for cylinder falling on itâ€™s side. You could look it up for other shapes.)
exp = the number e (2.71828) to the given exponent. This can be computed in Python with the Math library function math.exp(value).
sqrt = the square root of the given expression. This can be computed in Python with the Math library function math.sqrt(value).

Prompt the user for each of the variables described above.
Compute the value for the inner value c which is computed as:
c = (1 / 2) * p * A * C
Display the value c to three decimal places.
Compute and display the overall velocity. Display the value to three decimal places.
